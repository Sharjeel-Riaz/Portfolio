## Usage

I'm thrilled that you're interested in exploring the codebase of my personal
portfolio! While I encourage you to learn from it and adapt it to your own
needs, I kindly request that you give proper attribution as plagiarism is discouraged!

Please note that this website was not originally intended as a starter theme, so if you have any implementation questions, I recommend referring to the relevant documentation or seeking guidance from the respective technologies' official resources.

Feel free to fork this repository and explore the code. Just make sure to give
proper credit by linking back to my website. Thank you!

- To use EmailJS for the contact form functionality, create a `.env` file in the
  project folder after forking or cloning the project. This file will contain
  your keys, also known as environment variables.

- Add the following to your `.env` file:

```
VITE_EMAIL_SERVICE_KEY = "Your Email Service key without double quotes (Quotes are just to grab your attention)."

VITE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE_ID = "Your Email Template key without double quotes (Quotes are just to grab your attention)."

VITE_EMAIL_USER_ID = "Your Email User ID without double quotes (Quotes are just to grab your attention)."
```

- Open the terminal at the directory where you have the project and run `npm
install` to download all the necessary dependencies

- Now run `npm run dev` to open the local environment

- Feel free to use it or make any necessary modifications `:D`
